## Description

**cub3D** is a 3D raycasting engine inspired by classic games like *Wolfenstein 3D*. It renders a 3D world from a 2D grid using raycasting techniques, providing a first-person perspective for maze exploration. This project is part of the **42 Network curriculum** and is written entirely in **C**, leveraging the **MiniLibX** graphics library.
